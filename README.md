## Now I will tell you about my studies at the university and my career as a programmer.

**Uni/C#**

    At the university we study the c# programming language (Windows Forms). But I don't want to get attached to Windows. Despite this, I started getting my first money from programming at the university. I did tests, laboratory work. Now I'm doing term papers, but less and less often, as I'm trying very hard to learn Kotlin and the Android SDK.

**Kotlin**

    At the moment I am studying Kotlin at the JetBrains Academy (Trak Kotlin development). [I'm on JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/profile/234127706). My priority is to become an android developer.
